The enclosed Notebook.Rmd file contains all of the R code used to generate Figures 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, and Extended Data Figures 5 and 6 from the article by Phipps et al. entitled, "Collective interactions augment influenza A virus replication in a host-dependent manner," which can be found at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0749-2.

To generate the plots, open the Notebook.Rmd file, change the Proj.Home file path to the parent folder "~/GFHK99_Multiplicity" and execute the code via the "Knit to HTML" or "Run All Chunks" commands. 

Note that the package "cellrangerRkit" is not available from CRAN, and must be installed from GitHub using "devtools."
